# Coronastatus
> Report your health status to get a better overview of COVID-19 in your country (currently available in Norway & The Netherlands)

## What is this?
We don't know how many people have COVID-19. So we made a website where people can self-report symptoms. We plot the submissions on a map and show graphs with trends.

### Currently available in
* ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Norway: https://coronastatus.no
* ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± The Netherlands: https://coronastatus.nl
* ... want one for your country? Join our community: https://t.me/onzecorona

## Why?
The government is working on this, but they're too slow in getting something out fast.

## Who's behind this?
A bunch of developers from around the world that wanted to help out. This is not an official website from the health services.
