> Report your health status to get a better overview of COVID-19 in your country (currently in üá≥üá¥üá≥üá±üá∏üá∞)

## What is this?

We don't know how many people have COVID-19. So we made a website where people can self-report symptoms. We plot the submissions on a map and show graphs with trends.

### Countries where Coronastatus launches

- üá≥üá¥ Norway: https://coronastatus.no
- üá≥üá± The Netherlands: https://coronastatus.nl
- üá∏üá∞ Slovakia: https://coronastatus.sk

## Why?

The government is working on this, but they're too slow in getting something out fast.

## Who's behind this?

A bunch of developers from around the world that wanted to help out. This is not an official website from the health services.

## How to launch the site in your country

Adding a new language should be pretty straightforward. If you need help, you can always ask in the Telegram group chat or contact us by email. The following is needed in order to set up a new language:

- Add language-specific fields to the config
- In `app/locales` you have to add (follow filename convention of the files that are already there):
  - A word list that is used for generating unique profile links. If the word list contains between 1000 and 10000 words, you should set `PASSCODE_LENGTH: 4` in the config. If it contains more than 10000 words, `PASSCODE_LENGTH: 3` should be sufficient.
  - Translations for all the sentences in `en.json`. The keys are the same in all the `xx.json`-files, and the values are the translations. We recommend translating everything in the file first, and then testing the site in order to verify that the translations look ok in context.
  - List of municipalities (we can help with this).
  - List of postal code coordinates (we have a script for this).
- Configure URL paths in `app/domain/urls`
- Write a privacy statement in `app/views/privacy-statement`
- You also need a domain (preferably `coronastatus.tld` if it is available), and a server to run the app on. We can assist you with setting this up.
