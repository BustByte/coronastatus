<p class="subtitle">What data do we store about you and why?</p>

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p>
  We store gender to be able to say something about the distribution between men
  and women with symptoms.
</p>

<h3>Age goup</h3>
<p>
  We store age groups to distinguish which age groups experience symptoms.
</p>

<h3>Postcode</h3>
<p>
  To give the public insight into how many people show symptoms in the area
  where they live, we store postcodes. In this way we can show overview of the
  number of people with specific symptoms in different areas.
</p>

<h3>Test status</h3>
<p>
  We also save whether you have been tested and what the results of this test
  are. With this information we can calculate the percentage of the participants
  who show symptoms. We display this on a map.
</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>
  The symptoms you submit indicate whether you may be infected with the Covid-19
  virus. The timing of the onset of symptoms also gives an indication of how
  long you've been contagious. We collect this data and visualize it
  anonymously. In this way, the public can gain insight into how big the figures
  can be.
